The password analyser project based on python is a tool to assess the strength of your selected password by analysing the number of uppercase, lowercase, digits and special characters are present. It also checks the vulnerability of your password by converting it into SHA256 hash and checking it against the rockyou.txt dictionary which consists of various common and leaked passwords.

For successfuly running the code password_analyser.py, one must download the rockyou.txt file (133MB) from the given link and change the variable "wordlist_path" in the .py file with the path of their downloaded rockyou.txt file.
