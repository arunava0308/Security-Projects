The password analyser project based on python is a tool to assess the strength of your selected password by analysing the number of uppercase, lowercase, digits and special characters present. It also checks the vulnerability of your password by converting it into **SHA256** hash and checking it against the rockyou.txt dictionary which consists of various common and leaked passwords.

For successfuly running the code **_password_analyser.py_**, one must download the _**rockyou.txt**_ file (133MB) from the given link at **_Dictionary File_** and change the variable **_wordlist_path_** in the .py file with the path of their downloaded rockyou.txt file.
